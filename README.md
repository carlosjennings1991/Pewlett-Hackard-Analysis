# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

They call demographics the "hidden science". I don't know who "they" is, but needless to say it's an often overlooked field of study, one that is quite literally hiding in plain sight. A major demographic trend facing companies, like our case study 'Pewlett-Hackard' is wave of retirements coming from baby-boomer employees. Mirroring national demographics as a whole, there is a tremendous amount of workers born from roughly 1946 and 1964 who are leaving their posts, a trend aptly titled the 'silver tsunami'. 

This analysis reviews that phenomenon within one company in a number of ways:
** The number of people retiring **
** The departments they are retiring in **
** Their titles **
** How long they've been with the company **
